## Introduction
Road accidents are a major global issue, and faster accident detection can save lives by reducing emergency response times. This system detects accidents from live or recorded video by analyzing frames for accident-related features using a trained Deep learning model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for scripting
- **Deep Learning** for model training and accident detection
- **Jupyter Notebook** for training the model
- **OpenCV** for handling video and frame processing

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset (from Kaggle) for accident detection.
- **accident-classification.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook that trains the accident detection model and generates two important files:
  - **model.json**: Stores the modelâ€™s architecture.
  - **model_weights.h5**: Holds the weights learned during training.
- **detection.py**: Loads the model and applies it to detect accidents in live or recorded video.
- **camera.py**: Manages the camera input and runs `detection.py` on each frame to analyze and display accident predictions.

## Prerequisites
- **Python version** > 3.6
- **Python Libraries**: Install dependencies using the command below:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Basic knowledge of Python, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning is recommended for contributions.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nisargaramachandra/Accident_Detector.git
   ```
2. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > Note: A camera is required for live detection. Alternatively, you can use a pre-recorded video file.

3. **Train the Model**:
   - Open and run `accident-classification.ipynb` to train the accident detection model. This will generate two key files: `model.json` and `model_weights.h5`.

4. **Run the System**:
   - Once the model files are ready, execute the main program:
   ```bash
   python detection.py
   ```

## How It Works
1. **Model Training**: `accident-classification.ipynb` trains a Deep Learning model to recognize accidents from labeled data. The trained model architecture and weights are saved in `model.json` and `model_weights.h5`.
2. **Detection**: `detection.py` loads the model and processes live or recorded video frames, classifying each frame as an "accident" or "non-accident" frame, with a likelihood percentage.
3. **Display**: For each frame, the system displays the likelihood of an accident, providing a real-time detection system.

## Future Work
- **Automated Alert System**: Integrate an alarm or notification system to alert nearby emergency services with accident location and severity.
- **Enhanced Severity Detection**: Develop additional model capabilities to assess accident severity, aiding emergency response prioritization.

## About
This system is designed to address road safety concerns by detecting accidents quickly through Deep Learning. It is a step towards automated and intelligent surveillance for enhanced public safety.
